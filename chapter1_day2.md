In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

- Safety and Security: No one is gonna use what isn't secure and can't be trusted.
- Clarity: If you want easy adoption, you have to make whatever it is you are proposing as clear and easy to understand as possible.
- Approachability: A person is encouraged to use what they can easily pickup and get the hang of.
- Developer Experience: Developers are creators and so if you want them to thrive you have to provide the necessary tools needed and make them easy to use and even enjoyable if possible.
