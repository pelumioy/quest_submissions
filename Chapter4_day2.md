1. .link() is responsible for linking and providing access, a resource located in the storage of a user's account to either a public path (meaning everyone will have access to this, or private path (meaning only selected people will have access). It takes in 2 parameters; the private or public path and the target path (account storage, only accessible by the owner)


2. A resource interface works by restricting access to the main resource, acting somewhat like an extension of the main resource and only allowing the end user to see and interact with it in the way the owner has set. This will be acheived by linking the location of the main resource (/storage/) to the path you want; either /private/ or /public/.
