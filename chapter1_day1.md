The blockchain is a distributed database in the sense that there is no one central database hidden somewhere where records are stored, 
rather, every participant(node) is a part of network of nodes which all act as databases storing copies of the records with them. This way,
there will be more transparency and trust because every record can be vouched for.

Smart Contracts are pieces of code stored on the blockchain that act as instructions that are only executed or can only be executed when certain conditions are met. 
They can be used in most cases where middle men are involved because they will be able to replace those intermediaries.


A transaction is any payable function that changes or updates data on the blockchain, while a script is a piece of code that allows you to view state on the blockchain at no cost.
